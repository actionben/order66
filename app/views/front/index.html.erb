<div class="intro">
  <p>Order 66 is a pop-punk band from Surrey in England. Oh, go on, you know what pop punk is! It's what Green Day used to play before they went weird! And here's the thing - all our songs are about Star Wars! I know - awesome, right?</p>
  <p>The Star Wars stuff is in the lyrics, really. Some bits of the music from the movies sneak in there too, but it's not like we just play covers of the cantina band song (there's plenty of awesome bands taking care of that).</p>
  <p>We've played gigs with some sweet bands, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assorted_Jelly_Beans">Assorted Jelly Beans</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+JB+Conspiracy">The JB Conspiracy</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/zeeb">Zeeb?</a>, <a href="http://www.mrkamikaze.com/">Mr Kamikaze</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Mouscron-Belgium/Black-Sheep-Belgium/44827325889">Black Sheep</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Second+Time+Lucky">Second Time Lucky</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/A+Man+Down">A Man Down</a> - and the gigs we've got coming up are totally going to punish too!</p>
